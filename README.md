Ever since discovering Jeff Vascouver's Tandy Color Computer 3 emulator back in the late 90s, i've been itching to try my own hand at writing one myself. Over the intervening years since then, I have gradually been learning more and more of the skills needed to actually make an attempt at it, and I finally believe I'm (mostly) ready! I intend for it to be an open-source cross-platform emulator, so feel free check out my progress in the code. 

**Things that are working:**
- Most of the various video modes
- Joystick support either using the keyboard or mouse for Host Computer input
- Emulated Floppy Disk READ support
- Virtual Hard Drive (.vhd) Read/Write support

**Things NOT working or NOT implemented at all yet:**
- Emulated Floppy Disk WRITE support
- Sound
- Serial (Bitbanger) support
- Printer support
- Using Host Computer gamepads as input for Joystick
- Probably alot more stuff I haven't even realized yet :-D
