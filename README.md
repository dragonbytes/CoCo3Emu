Why write yet another CoCo 3 emulator when we already have an excellent assortment of extremely capable and stable emulators? Well, mainly to see if I can! Ever since discovering Jeff Vavasour's CoCo emulators back in the late 90s, i've been itching to try and write one of my own someday. Over the intervening years, I have been accumulating more and more of the skills needed to actually make an attempt at it, and I finally believe I'm (mostly) ready! One thing that might make my emulator unique is that I hope to eventually have NATIVE builds for both Android and iOS, and perhaps even in the official App Store since Apple has relaxed their anti-emulator stance in recent years. For the moment though, while i'm still deep in the development stage, it only builds for Windows under Visual Studio. If you find this interesting, feel free to follow along as I hopefully progress towards something I can actually call "fully functional"! 

**Things that are working:**
- Most of the various video modes
- Joystick support either using the keyboard or mouse for Host Computer input
- Emulated Floppy Disk READ support
- Virtual Hard Drive (.vhd) Read/Write support

**Things NOT working or NOT implemented at all yet:**
- Emulated Floppy Disk WRITE support
- Sound
- Serial (Bitbanger) support
- Printer support
- Using Host Computer gamepads as input for Joystick
- Probably alot more stuff I haven't even realized yet :-D
